# Examples

Practical routing scenarios that build on the quickstart to illustrate real-world use cases. Each subsection walks through a concrete workflow end to end.

- [Routing a RAPID Project](rapid.md): ingest RAPID configurations and route runoff with staged operators.
- [Defining a Custom IRF](custom_irf.md): register a new impulse response function and route with it.
